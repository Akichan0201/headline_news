# 📢 Today News Scraper 📰✨

Tired of doom-scrolling Kompas manually? Same.
So I wrote a lil’ Python gremlin that sneaks into `search.kompas.com`, grabs the headlines, and neatly tosses them into an Excel sheet for you. 🧹📊

## ⚡️ What it does

- Scrapes the latest **articles from Kompas search (berita hari ini)

- Pulls the title, link, genre, and date

- Cleans up those messy whitespaces (goodbye random tabs & newlines 👋)

- Translates Indo month names into English so pandas doesn’t cry

- Sorts everything by date (freshest on top or bottom, your choice)

- Saves it all to a shiny Excel file: Today_News.xlsx

## 🛠 How to run
```
python main.py
```

**Boom**. You’ve got yourself an Excel full of news.

## Why tho?

Because sometimes scrolling the site is a headache, and having data in Excel just feels **✨chef’s kiss✨**. Plus, it’s way easier to flex charts & analysis for school, work, or… idk, your TikTok content?
